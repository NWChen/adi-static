A great paper to start out with is [Improving Video Bitrate Selection and Adaptation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WLHOVpV8QxiO7ON0AlM0VQW2ZJdkiym/view?usp=sharing). We've collected a bunch of other papers in our drive:

Potential discussion questions:

- Is there an optimal way to maximize video quality while minimize buffering?
- What are some challenges to streaming to mobile users?
